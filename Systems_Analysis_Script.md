Introduction
========================================================

Investing time and money into a computer or information system without a clear 
course of action can be expensive and wasteful. By taking some time to fully 
consider the issue at hand and pursue a disciplined approach to finding a 
practical solution, you greatly increase your odds of success and decrease 
costs. We call this process *Systems Analysis*.


Systems Development Life Cycle
========================================================

Systems analysis is an important part of an overall approach to *systems development*.

The life of an information system follows a cycle. The classic development 
model is called the Systems Development Life Cycle, or SDLC.

Planning Phase
--------------

The [Planning](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle#System_investigation) 
phase defines the primary issue (*problem* or *goal*) and performs a 
[feasibility study](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasibility_study). Here, you 
clarify the project scope, compare your best options, and come up with a plan.

Analysis Phase
--------------

The [Analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle#System_analysis) 
phase focusses on the issue, defined previously, and studies its role in the 
current (or proposed) system. The system is explored, piece by piece, in light 
of the project goals, to determine system requirements.

Design Phase
------------

In the [Design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_development_life_cycle#Design) 
phase, a detailed model of the proposed system is created. Various components 
or modules address each of the requirements identified earlier.

Implementation Phase
--------------------

During the [Implementation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implementation#Information_Technology_.28IT.29) 
phase, a working system is built from the design and put into use.

Maintenance Phase
--------------------

The [Maintenance](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_maintenance) phase 
includes ongoing updates and evaluation. As changes are needed, the cycle 
repeats with more planning, analysis, and so on.

We will take a closer look at the **[systems analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis)** 
phase next.

What will you need?
========================================================

Essentially, in *[Systems analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis)* 
we answer the question, "*What will you need* to reach your goal?" In other 
words, **"What are your requirements?"**

A **primary goal** of this course is to help you develop your skills in 
*[requirements analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis)*.

[Systems analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis) helps you 
**clarify your project needs** and **plan ahead** in order to 
*obtain and allocate* **critical resources**.

The main idea here is ...

> If you don't *know* what you *need*, how can you *ask* for it?

Systems Analysis
========================================================

After completing an initial 
[feasibility study](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feasibility_study) 
to "determine if creating a new or improved system is a viable solution", 
proposing the project, and gaining approval from 
[stakeholders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_stakeholder), you may then 
conduct a [systems analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis). 

[Systems analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis) will involve 
"[breaking down](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_breakdown_structure) the 
system in different pieces to analyze the situation, **analyzing project goals**, 
breaking down what needs to be created and attempting to **engage users** so that 
**[definite requirements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis)** 
can be defined."

Systems Analysis Definition
========================================================

So, what, exactly, *is* "Systems Analysis"?

* "A *system* is a set of interacting or interdependent components"<sup style="font-size:.5em">1</sup>
* *Analysis* means "to take apart"<sup style="font-size:.5em">2</sup>

Lonnie D. Bentley, author of *Systems Analysis and Design for the Global Enterprise*, writes:

> [Systems analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis) is a problem 
solving technique that decomposes a system into its component pieces for the 
purpose of the studying how well those component parts work and interact to 
accomplish their purpose.<sup style="font-size:.5em">3</sup>

We will accomplish this analysis by working through a series of 
[five phases](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_analysis#Information_technology).

Systems Analysis Phases
========================================================

Systems Analysis has its own series of phases. We will look at each of these 
one by one.

![systems analysis phases](./images/systems_analysis_01.png)

During [Scope definition](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_%28project_management%29), 
we establish our system boundaries. In our 
[Problem analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Problem_statement) phase, we 
identify the symptoms and causes. Our 
[Requirements analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis) 
determines our system goals. The 
[Logical design](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_design#Logical_design) 
phase models relationships within the system. And our 
[Decision analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis) evaluates 
the various alternatives.

</small>

Scope Definition
========================================================

So, do we mean by *scope*?

> **Scope** involves *getting information* required to start a project, and 
the *features* the product would need to have in order to meet its 
*stakeholders requirements*.

Put another way, *project* scope defines the *work to be done* whereas 
*product* scope is concerned with the *desired features and functions*.

By being careful to define scope *early on*, we can be more watchful for 
*scope creep*.

> **Scope creep** is [...] the *incremental expansion* of the scope of a 
project [...], while nevertheless *failing to adjust* the schedule and budget.

</small>

Problem Analysis
========================================================

Problem analysis is critical. When we say, *problem*, we can also think *goal*, 
*research question*, or *issue*. If you don't get this right, you can waste a 
lot of time and money solving the *wrong problem* or address a *non-issue*.

We can summarize the key points of problem analysis (with some help from 
Jenette Nagy of Kansas University) as:

- Define and clarify the problem (or issue)
    * *What exactly are we trying to solve?*
- Determine the problem's importance
    * *How much does it matter?*
- Assess the feasibility of solving the problem
    * *Do we have the resources we need?*
- Consider any negative impacts (unintended consequences)
    * *What could go wrong?*
- Prioritize problems to solve (bottlenecks? low-hanging fruit?)
    * *What are the most critical issues?*
- Answer: *what*, *why*, *who*, *when*, *where*, and *how much*?
    * *Drill down into the problem with all kinds of questions to expose dependencies.*
- Find **causes** (especially [root cause](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Root_cause_analysis)) 
and **symptoms** (effects)
    * *What is really going on here?*

</small>

Root Cause Analysis
========================================================

There are several methods of root cause analysis, but one simple one is ...

*"Ask Why Five Times"*

![Ask Why Five Times](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/20/Root_Cause_Analysis_Tree_Diagram.jpg)

... where you keep asking "Why? But, why? But, Why?" over and over again until 
there is a clear root cause that you can actually do something about.

A real example is mentioned in 
[Ask Why 5 Times, Business Analysis Guidebook/Root Cause Analysis (wikibooks.org)](http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Business_Analysis_Guidebook/Root_Cause_Analysis#Ask_Why_5_Times), 
where the US National Park Service was able to slow the rate of deterioration 
of the Jefferson memorial simply by changing the lighting schedule.

This method may also be used in Requirements Analysis.

</small>

Requirements Analysis
========================================================

- [Elicit, Analyze, and Record (EAR)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis#Overview):
  * System and project [requirements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis)

EAR Analysis is all about *listening*.

Gather requirements by interviewing stakeholders. Observe how people currently 
do their work or use the system. Make sure the requirements are detailed, 
clear, unambigious, and comprehensive. Document the requirements as a list, 
in diagrams, or narratives.

As an example, in Spring 2014, we held a meeting with our graduate students 
and asked them about what sort of computing needs they had. We had a 
discussion, *listened* to what they had to say, summarized the main concerns, 
and documented them.

- Further elucidate [Measurable goals](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis#Measurable_goals)

By continuing to ask questions like "Why? ... Why? ... Why? ...", get more 
specific until the goals become quantifiable. Measured goals are easier to 
meet since you can measure your progress in achieving them.

Mission objectives determine the goals. Compare the stated goals against 
mission objectives to produce a small set of critical, measured goals.

- Output: [Requirements specification](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_specification)

This document will be used in the *logical design* phase to model the 
relationships within the system. So, it should be clear and thorough. The more 
specific and unambiguous this specification is, the easier it will be to design 
the system to meet the requirements.

One way to be more clear is to organize the requirements by type.

</small>

Requirements Categories
-----------------------

You may categorize requirements according to several important types:

[Types of requirements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_analysis#Types_of_Requirements):

Operational requirements are the **utility, effectiveness, and deployment** 
needs, with repect to practical use of the system within the overall operation. 
These are the **customer Requirements**.

[Functional](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement) requirements are specific things the system must **do**.

[Non-functional](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement) requirements are specific things the system must **provide**.

[Architectural](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_architecture) requirements define how the system must be **structured**, in other words, how the components must **interrelate**.

Behavioral requirements describe how **users** and other systems will 
**interact** with the system and how the **system** will respond.

Performance requirements define **how well** the systems needs to do things, 
**measured** in terms of quantity, quality, coverage, timeliness or readiness.

While there are other ways to group requirements, these are the most 
significant categories.

Requirements Modeling: Example
========================================================

Another way to make requirements clear is through *requirements modeling*. 
Here is an example of modeling behavioral requirements with a 
[Use Case Diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case).

**Survey Data System**

The behavioral requirements are stated in **role** *goal* format.

- **Researcher** *uploads survey*.
- **Subject** *takes survey*.
- **Subject** *uploads results*.
- **Researcher** *downloads results*.

Gramatically speaking, the role is the *subject* and the goal is stated as a *verb* and its *object*. Each of these requirements forms the basis of a *use case*.

Use Case Diagram
----------------

The [Use Case Diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_case) is a standard 
means of showing these requirements pictorially.

![research survey data system](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brianhigh/data-workshop/master/images/research_survey_data_system.png)

</small>

Here, human *actors* are depicted as stick figures. These are the **roles**. 
The *goal* is the line connecting the role to a system activity or function, 
shown as an oval. In this example, the *system* is drawn as a box with the 
actors outside the box. The reason is that the system's *product scope* was 
defined to be the electronic data system. The human actors interact with that 
system. The information flowing to and from an actor, as well as data flows 
within a system, will be modeled in the *logical design*.

Logical Design
========================================================

Once system behaviours have been modeled from the perspective of user 
interaction, we can begin to model the internal workings of the system with 
the *logical design*. The *logical* part means that this is an 
*abstract representation* of the system. Therefore, the system is modeled 
in terms of abstractions such as *data flows, entities, and relationships*. 
We model how the system will satisfy function requirements such as 
*inputs and outputs*. To make the abstract more concrete, we make use of 
*Graphical modeling* techniques to produce graphics such as the 
[Data Flow Diagram (DFD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_flow_diagram) and 
[Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model).

</small>

Example Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)
-----------------------------------------

For example, let's consider a systems which records the playlists of musical 
performances at a local pub. You will want to store which artist performs which 
song. The relationship between an artist and a song can be shown in a 
simple [Entity Relationship Diagram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity%E2%80%93relationship_model). We start with the behavioral *use case* written as **Artist** *performs Song*. Then,
using a standard set of symbols, we can produce this diagram.

![artist performs song](http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/91/ERD-artist-performs-song.svg/640px-ERD-artist-performs-song.svg.png)

The boxes represent *entities* and the line connecting them is the relationship. 
Here, the symbols indicate that there is a one-to-many relationship. This diagram 
is saying that exactly one artist performs one or more songs, (or doesn't perform 
any). 

Since this "system" describes only solo performers, you would want to model 
it differently to include groups of artists that perform more than one song. You 
would want a many-to-many relationship as well as other entities to represent the 
musical groups. Since there will by many performances, you will also want an 
entity to represent the performances. 

The value of this type of diagram is that complex relationships can be mapped 
to a great level of detail. In fact, they can be used to automatically generate 
database schemas.

Logical Design: Diagrams
========================================================

Several examples of these diagrams can be found in the 
[Systems Analysis and Design](https://github.com/brianhigh/data-workshop/blob/master/Systems_Analysis_and_Design.md) turorial.

[MP4](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/951183/modules/items/5479995))

Decision Analysis
========================================================

These models and diagrams will help you make a very important decision. Before 
you go further in the system design process, you need to decide whether to buy 
a system or build one. Or you may consider building a system of components, 
some of which you might buy and others might be custom built. You will want to 
come up with a few of the best alternatives and present them to your 
stakeholders. In your case that might be your lab manager, principal 
investigator, or funding agency. 

Your presentation will also include a 
[Decision analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis) to weigh  
the pros and cons of the various options against the requirements in order to 
help the stakeholders with their decision. You should conclude your 
analysis with a recommendation of your top choice and explain why this choice 
is the most compelling. Then you will want to get a decision, and the approval 
to continue, before you invest any more time on further analysis.

The system development life cycle (SDLC) continues on to other phases, which we 
do not have time to cover here. However, we hope that this glimpse at the systems 
analysis phase has demonstrated the value of this approach in gathering and 
clarifying requirements that can be used to design and build an information 
system.
