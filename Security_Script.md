Philosophies and Foundations
=========================================================
Before getting into specifics, is probably worthwhile spend a few minutes looking at philosophical underpinnings of information security. There is no single philosophy or underpinning foundation, but arrange, a spectrum of philosophies from different viewpoints.

There is a quote, attributed to Frederick the great, that posits "he who defends everything defends nothing". Which is popular among some security professionals. It is probably worthwhile to look at the converse assertion "he who does not defend everything defends nothing". Frederick was talking about war and the need to manage limited resources and logistics to achieve a strategic victory. This does have bearing in information security as the resources that any one organization can bring to bear to secure the organization are limited. The contrary assertion however, matters a lot in the "info sec" world, where the failure to secure even innocent – looking assets could lead to a much greater compromise of the organization's information.

So what is one to do? How do you decide where to spend your finite, Limited resources and time to protect your data and information?

One cornerstone of good information security practices is that of risk management. While it might sound rather dull, a risk management approach is key to making decisions that optimize the application of your resources to secure your information and the organization.

One truism that most information security professionals would agree with is that "There is no silver bullet.", meaning that there is no single technology or technique or philosophy that will adequately protect information in a complex world. Most every information security plan will require a multifaceted approach that combines defensive methods along with procedures that mitigate the adverse effects of security exploits and breaches. If you ever hear someone proclaim "We are okay. We have a firewall!" You are probably looking through a window into a future information security disaster. successful security practice is implemented in multiple layers, of "layered defense".

With other topics remaining to be discussed we may be forced to give risk management short shrift. It is an area that could consume hours days months years, and to which some people have devoted their entire careers. That being said, at the beginning of any project and more usefully before it is even launched (or funded!), It is essential to devote some time to an assessment of the projects risks.

This is not cut and dried. While it might be easy to identify all risk such as losing data on a laptop that gets stolen, other risks might be less tangible yet important. For example, what if the lost data on that laptop leads to the cancellation of a project or an unsuccessful grant renewal?

Paradoxically an asset can be a risk. For example think about the very bright data analyst you hired for the project and who is the only person in the project who truly understands some of your statistical methods. They are an asset to the project until they take a new, highly paid position in Paris. In impersonal terms, they were always a risk really.

One risk is that you could spend too much time on risk assessment!



CIA (AAA)
========================================================

Some key tenets of information security are often described using the term "CIA". In its simplest form this stands for confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Confidentiality should be ready self-explanatory only people who should have access to information get it. Integrity means that your data is correct at least with respect to your expectation of what the data should be. Availability is a lofty term for making sure that you can get your data – that your data management system is built and designed in such a way that it will continue to make your data available to authorized parties and mitigate against threats to availability whether they be computer failure, network failure, a malicious exploit, or something else.

Controls
========================================================

A successful information security and data management LAN will address specific risks by means of specific controls. These can be looked at in a few different ways. One main way is the type of control. Several important types along with some examples include:

– administrative (for example written policies)
– logical (computer accounts are the most common example)
– physical (door locks and access cards for example)

Another primary way to look at security controls is whether they attempt to prevent the occurrence of a risk event, reduce the impact of a risk event if it does occur, or restore your systems and information when a risk event occurs with full impact.

Let's look at a simple example of domestic burglary risk management.

A loud barking dog in the front yard would primarily be a preventative control as might a sticker or sign that says "this premises has an alarm system". If the burglar feeds your dog a handful of tranquilizers, then the burglar may gain access to your premises and then the alarm system could come into play this time as a mitigating control, wherein the amount of loot the burglar can haul away is reduced by the approach of police sirens responding to the alarm. But let's say the burglar hauls away everything including your most valuable possessions, photos of your family and of Elvis Presley. If you have been prudent data manager and digitized all of those family and Elvis photos then stored them on a hard drive in a safe deposit box, then you have implemented a strong restorative control.

- Administrative (policies)
- Logical (accounts)
- Physical (door locks)

Access control
========================================================

- Identification
- Authentication
- Authorization

A key element to securing data is the concept of access control. This includes the requirement that a party successfully identify themselves and that is followed by a requirement to authenticate this identification. Authentication can take a number of distant different forms including a stored secret that is known only to you or device like a smart card. You are probably familiar with recent discussions about a move to so-called "multifactor" authentication systems in payment card systems and ATMs where a combination of password plus physical device are required.

Authorization relies on successful authentication but provides a different service – that of granting rights to individual parties based on membership in defined groups or roles. A very simple example from our department: two edit some particular pages on the department's website, you need to be a member of the group "web team".. 

Further assurance for your stored data
========================================================

Remember that controls can operate in different realms, sometimes at the same time.

For example backups may not be a completely successful preventative tool in deterring the risk of some of your data – let's say that a the day's worth of your data was lost due to an equipment failure for someone's failure to save their work. However, those same backup controls could be an excellent preventative control when looking at the risk of losing your business or a grant renewal or contract.

Typically backups are tailored to capture data that is still in active use in a business. At some point it may become prohibitively expensive to continue to back up data that is not in active use. This is the point at which a business would consider storing legacy data in some type of lower-cost archive. Archives can be critical control measures depending on the circumstances including things like regulatory and contract compliance.

We should mention in passing that some systems, like ours, have the ability to take so-called "snapshots" of stored data at desired intervals. This provides a mechanism to do a previous version of a stored file and more or less "rollback" the document or data. Some advanced data systems have this rollback built in and use concepts such as journaling to be able to look at state of the data at any moment in time.

Probably much more important and of much more utility to average folks managing average data is the concept of versioning and version control. version control is useful on a number of different levels. Most commonly associated with the control of programming source code, version control is essential especially when multiple parties are collaborating on the same programming tasks. The version control offers great benefits even for an individual user, and even managing the versioning of things like documents or evolving data sets. Formal version control systems use a defined repository to store versioned data. We have implemented one here in the department using the software called "git"and that repository is integrated with our Redmine system.
