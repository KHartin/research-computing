== Research Computing

This resource contains the slides in R Markdown format as well as scripts to
go with those slides. The scripts will eventually be made into wiki pages and
then will be compiled in PDF and Epub ebooks.

The target audience is primarily college students, particularly graduate students, 
who conduct academic or scientific research. The information will also be useful 
for working professionals.
