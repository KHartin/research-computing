Programming definitions
========================================================

- Defined as "a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs" (Wikipedia)

- A way to communicate with a computing system and give it instructions on how to operate.

- The development of "applications".

Programming Languages
========================================================

Writing a program or script is done in a programming "language". Languages can be general use or specific to an application. There are some best suited to specific tasks, like scripting, database programming, or the web.

Examples of languages:

- General use
 * Python, C++, Java, Perl, Bash, C#
- Web
 * JavaScript, PHP, Ruby
- Databases
 * SQL

Writing code
========================================================

- Installing the language
 * Sometimes langauges are built into your OS (python, perl on Macs)
 * Otherwise, they need to be installed before your computer can run your code.
- Editing
 * Writing code can be a simple as opening a basic text editor and getting to work.
 * There are text editors that provide useful tools like Syntax Highlighting (color codes key words) and auto-completion. 
 * There are also full development environments for some languages that make writing, editing, and debugging (removing errors) much easier.
 
Programming basics
========================================================
- Variables
- Data types
- Statements
- Flow control

Variables
========================================================
Just like in math, variables are a stand in for a value. They can be a static value, or something that can change over the course of the program runtime.
 
Variable types:
- Scalar: Single-value variable
- List or Array: A compound of multiple values (scalars) stored as one variable

Data types
========================================================

- Data types:
 * Integer: A non-decimal number. Can also be negative or zero.
 * Float / double: A decimal value. 
 * String: A value consisting of a series of characters (including letters, numbers, and/or symbols)
 * Boolean: A True or False value

Statements
========================================================
 
A programming statement is the smallest standalone element that allows code to be carried out. This can be as simple as assigning a variable a value, or you can have compound statements as a block of code that is more complex.

Examples:
 - Assignments
  * x = 5
  * GroceryList = ("Bread", "Milk", "Apples")


Flow control
========================================================

A program or script will run through each statement or operation in a logical sequence. To control the order of the operations, we use flow control: 

- Conditional statements
 * If [x] then do [y] 
- Loops
 * While [a] is true, do [b]
 * For [item] in [list], do something
- Functions
  * A block of code that can be reused.
- Exceptions
 * Used to break out of code, if something goes wrong.
 
Language Types
========================================================

There are many different language types, which behave in different ways.

- Imperative
 * Declares how a program operates, by defining a seqeunce of commands. 
- Declarative
 * A program that describes what computation should be performed and not how to compute it.
- Object oriented
 *  These languages are oriented around "objects" instead of actions. 
 
Regular Expressions Part 1
========================================================

Regular expressions (regex) are a kind of sophisticated wildcard that allow for complex searching and pattern matching operations. They are frequently used in programming.

Regex uses a combination of standard characters and symbols to do pattern matching. Alpha numeric characters (a-z and 0-9) are matched literally. There are several "special" characters that have specific functions. They are:

[\\\^\$.|?*+(){}



Regular Expressions Part 2
========================================================

The backslash (\\) escapes a special character's function, so that you can use it literally (eg. \\? will let you match a question mark).

Backslash also assigns special functions to certain letters (eg. \\d matches a numerical digit from 0 to 9).

Regex functions are tpyically standard, but can change slightly depending on the programming language, so be sure to reference your language documentation when using Regex.
